# Snake
A highly parallel, abstract, ~~completely overengineered~~ snake game engine.

Simulate multiple snake games in parallel as a large set of finite state machines. Abstracted over directional input returning state changes. 

Each game has a unique board size and tick rate. Allowing it to support games across varied clients.
